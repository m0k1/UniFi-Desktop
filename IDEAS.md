> This is IDEA file; I write here all brain storming about this project.

When you run this app, you will get prompt to enter user name and password of UniFi login, and to select your country/language...
There is 2 cases if pc is alredy connected to internet and if it's not connected to internet.

OFFLINE CASE:
If NO INTERNET acccess is detected it will create UniFi wirless profile (on windows/linux/mac). And it will try to connect/detect UniFi WIFI network, using creditionals you entered.

ONLINE CASE:
If there IS INTERNET access it will validate your UniFi login. If login is fine it will create UniFi Wifi Profile (on windows/linux/mac) and it will prompt you do you want to connect to UniFi network via WIFI now. (if there is actual UniFi AP(access point)). 


After all is setup, there will be several futures.
AUTO RECONNECT - Auto reconnect to UniFi AP if get disconnected.
STATUS - Status of your UniFi account. It will show how mutch data you spent/left  ...
OFFLINE MAP - Offline map of Unifi Access Point's
LOCATIONS - Offline location's data
FAVORITE LOCATIONS - List of user's favorite location's


Why the hell we need this app ?
Becouse there is not automated autoconfigure of UniFi and for end users it's hard to configure/create UniFi wifi profile. This app will autoconfigure all of that + it's having auto reconnect feature for UniFi. It's easy/simple to use for any user. Whole setup is automated. Checking and evrything + it's alot faster than web app ( http://unifi.sbb.rs ) couse all data (maps,locations ...) is pre-cached.

There will be option to download app with pre cached data (maps/locations) that's alot bigger and there will be smaller app. Without pre cached data aka LITE VERSION.
